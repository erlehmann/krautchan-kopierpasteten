Bernd I have seriously fucked up.

My mom made a comment about my late-night web browsing habits at breakfast today:
>Why are you always up so late on the computer, Bernd?  Talking to girls?
>Heh.. yeah..
>Oh really?  What's her name?
>Um.. Kacey.
>She sounds nice.  What do you two talk about?
>Well.. She's into history and politics and stuff like me.
>Do you spend a lot of time with this girl?
>Oh sure.  I'll probably be hanging out with her again tonight.
>Is she ... your girlfriend?
>Um.. Well I guess you could call her that lol

Well it fucking turns out that I thought they were going to the movies tonight but they're not my mom and all my family are staying in tonight and she keeps making comments about "Kacey" and talking abuot "Kacey" she asked my sister if she'd met my girlfriend "Kacey" and she giggled and my mom asked if "Kacey" was a girl from school. Now my dad and my uncle keep asking me about it too.

I accidentally told them that Kacey was coming over this weekend and now they all want to meet her my mom even said she'd make a "special dinner". They'r shocked that I'm talking to another person let alone a female because I barely even leave my room I'm a 25 yeara old hikki NEET with no friends they probably think i'm gay pedofile or something.

BERND WHAT THE FUCK DO I DO NOW??
